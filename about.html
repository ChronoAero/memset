        Memset is a utility I am trying to work on to actively recall on what I learn. I find myself keep forgetting concepts I am able to grasp well in the past...

        You are welcome to read the study resources on my page, I will be updating it based on courses I am enrolled in or planning to enroll into. I will try my best to avoid copyright issues regarding the sources, please contact me if you do want to remove something. Otherwise, you may also fork this page and modify it for yourself.

        I am developing this utility with <a href="https://alpinejs.dev" class="underline text-blue-700">alpine.js</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" class="underline text-blue-700">tailwindcss</a> to make it convenient to handle the annoying part but still keeping it minimal. Doing something rather unconventional like this, I am indeed concerned about security issues (there can't be much that can affect usage, though... but maybe something like XSS is still possible). Please post bugs to the github repository issue section.

        The name memset is inspired by the built-in C function <span class="bg-gray-300 text-blue-700 font-bold rounded-md p-1">memset()</span>, which is used to allocate memory.
